# Auditing
{: #auditing}

You can monitor data access in your {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} instance with the built-in Db2 audit facility. You can use the Db2 audit facility to generate and maintain an audit trail for a series of predefined database events, including attempts to access or manipulate database objects, user authentication, SQL statement execution, and even access to the audit log. You can use the audit log to reveal usage patterns that would identify system misuse, and in turn, take action to eliminate such misuse.
