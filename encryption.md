# Data security & encryption
{: #encryption}

The {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} service has security built into all levels of its architecture.
{: shortdesc}

The following methods are used to secure your data:
- Data at rest and database backups are encrypted using NIST SP 800-131A compliant cryptographic algorithms
- Data in motion is encrypted through SSL/TLS
- Backplane network connectivity is supported through IBM Cloud Service Endpoints
- Database-level security is supported through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Row and Column Access Control (RCAC)

Administrators can make encrypted connections mandatory. For more information, see [SSL connectivity](/docs/Db2whc?topic=Db2whc-ssl_support).
