# Migration to IBM Cloud
{: #migration}

You can load data from a data file in a delimited format (CSV or TXT) located on a local network or in an object store (Amazon S3 or IBM Cloud Object Storage) to {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}}. You can even migrate your data from an on-premises system.
{: shortdesc}

## Load data from object store
{: #cos}

To load data from Amazon S3, select one of the following methods:
  * {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} web console. **Load > Amazon S3**. 
  * External Tables directly. The following is an example SQL statement:

    ```
    INSERT INTO <table-name> SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL '<mys3file.txt>' USING
      (CCSID 1208 s3('s3.amazonaws.com', 
      '<S3-access-key-ID>',
      '<S3-secret-access-key>', 
      '<my_bucket>'
         )
      )      
    ```

To load data from IBM Cloud Object Storage by using External Tables directly, the following is an example SQL statement:

```
INSERT INTO <table-name> SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL '<mys3file.txt>' USING
  (CCSID 1208 s3('s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net', 
  '<S3-access-key-ID>',
  '<S3-secret-access-key>', 
  '<my_bucket>'
     )
  )      
```

**Note:** For IBM Cloud Object Storage, to create HMAC credentials when creating new service credentials, specify {"HMAC:true"} in the *Add Inline Configuration Parameters* field.

## Migrate data from on-premises system
{: #onprem}

To migrate your data from an on-premises system, choose one of the following methods depending on the size of your data set:
* Less than 25 TB of data: [IBM Lift CLI](#lift)
* 25 TB of data and greater: [IBM Cloud Mass Data Migration](#mdms)

### Lift CLI
