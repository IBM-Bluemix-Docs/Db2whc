# Migrating data to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #migration}

You can load data from a data file in a delimited format (CSV or TXT) located on a local network or in an object store (Amazon S3 or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Object Storage) to {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}}. You can even migrate your data from an on-premises system.
{: shortdesc}

## Loading data from object store
{: #cos}

To load data from Amazon S3, select one of the following methods:
  * {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} web console. **Load > Amazon S3**. 
  * External Tables directly. The following is an example SQL statement:

    ```
    INSERT INTO <table-name> SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL '<mys3file.txt>' USING
      (CCSID 1208 s3('s3.amazonaws.com', 
      '<S3-access-key-ID>',
      '<S3-secret-access-key>', 
      '<my_bucket>'
         )
      )      
    ```

To load data from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Object Storage by using External Tables directly, the following is an example SQL statement:

```
INSERT INTO <table-name> SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL '<mys3file.txt>' USING
  (CCSID 1208 s3('s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net', 
  '<S3-access-key-ID>',
  '<S3-secret-access-key>', 
  '<my_bucket>'
     )
  )      
```

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Object Storage, to create HMAC credentials when creating new service credentials, specify {"HMAC:true"} in the *Add Inline Configuration Parameters* field.
