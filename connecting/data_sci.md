## Watson Studio
{: #watson_studio}

After you create a project in IBM Watson Studio (formerly Data Science Experience), you add data assets to it so that you can work with data. All the collaborators in the project are automatically authorized to access the data in the project.
{: shortdesc}

How you add data and from where you can add data differs between legacy and IBM Watson projects. IBM Watson projects use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Object Storage. The project is a legacy project if it uses Object Storage OpenStack Swift. 

### To create a new connection in an IBM Watson project:

1. Click **Add to project > Connection**.
    
2. Choose a data source.
    
3. Enter the connection information required for your data source. Typically, you need to provide information like the host, port number, user name, and password.
    
4. You can discover assets from connections to {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}, which gives you the ability to add all tables from the connection as data assets to a project. Select **Discover data assets** and choose a project.
    
5. Click **Create**. The connection appears on the **Assets** page.

Watch this video to see how to create a connection and add connected data to a project.

## SAS
{: #sas}

These instructions explain how to create a connection from SAS to a {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database.
{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq12}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database, verify that you have the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/services/Db2whc/connecting?topic=Db2whc-connect_ov#prereqs).

### Procedure
{: #proc12}

For steps on how to connect from SAS to a {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database, see the SAS documentation:
- [SAS/ACCESS Interface to DB2 under UNIX and PC Hosts](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=acreldb&docsetTarget=p1dzq4zjg1iycgn16l4xj9nnvibt.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en){:external}

## R development environment
{: #r_dev_env}

Instead of using the RStudio速 environment that is integrated within IBM Watson Studio, you might prefer to use your own, locally-installed R development environment. For example, you might have your own RStudio installation, or you might prefer to use some other development tool such as Rcmdr or Rattle. These instructions explain how to connect an R development environment to a {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database.
{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq13}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database, verify that you have the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/services/Db2whc/connecting?topic=Db2whc-connect_ov#prereqs).

### Procedure
{: #proc13}

1. In your local R environment, install the `ibmdbR` package by entering the following command:

   `install.packages("ibmdbR")`

   Your local R environment accesses the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and automatically downloads and installs the `ibmdbR` package and any prerequisite packages that are not already installed.
    
2. Create an ODBC driver connection between your R development environment and your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database:
        
   a. [Set up your database as an ODBC data source](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6NHC/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.doc/connecting/connect_connecting_cli_and_odbc_applications.html){:external}.
        
   b. Open your locally installed R development environment.
        
   c. At the R prompt, enter the following statements to create the connection. Replace the placeholders with the [connection information](/docs/services/Db2whc/connecting?topic=Db2whc-db_details_cxn_creds#db_details_cxn_creds) that you collected beforehand.

   - If your locally installed R development environment runs in the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database:

     ```
     library(ibmdbR)
     host.name <- "placeholderForYourHostName"
     port <-"placeholderForPortNumber" # 50000 if not using SSL or 50001 if using SSL
     user.name <-"placeholderForYourUserName"
     pwd <- "placeholderForYourPassword"
     con.text <- paste("placeholderForYourDSNName;DRIVER=BLUDB",
                       ";Database=BLUDB",
                       ";Hostname=",host.name,
                       ";Port=",port,
                       ";PROTOCOL=TCPIP",
                       ";UID=", user.name,
                       ";PWD=",pwd,sep="")
     # Connect to using a odbc Driver Connection string to a remote database
     con <- idaConnect(con.text)
     ```

   - If your locally installed R development environment does not run in the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database:

     ```
     library(ibmdbR)
     driver.name <- "{placeholderForYourDriverName}"
     db.name <- "placeholderForYourDatabaseName"
     host.name <- "placeholderForYourHostName"
     port <-"placeholderForYourPort"
     user.name <-"placeholderForYourUserName"
     pwd <- "placeholderForYourPassword"
     con.text <- paste("placeholderForYourDSNName;DRIVER=",driver.name,
                       ";Database=",db.name,
                       ";Hostname=",host.name,
                       ";Port=",port,
                       ";PROTOCOL=TCPIP",
                       ";UID=", user.name,
                       ";PWD=",pwd,sep="")
     # Connect to using a odbc Driver Connection string to a remote database
     con <- idaConnect(con.text)
     ```

     The statement that is used to create the connection object uses the `idaConnect()` method, not the `odbcConnect()` or `odbcDriverConnect()` methods.
     {: note}
        
   d. Initialize the analytics package by issuing the following R command:

   `idaInit(con)`

   e. To test whether the connection is working, issue the following R command:

   `idaShowTables()`

   The console displays a list of all of the tables and views in the current schema.
