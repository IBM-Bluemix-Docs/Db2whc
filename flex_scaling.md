# Flexible scaling
{: #scale}

Independent scaling of storage and compute cores.

Before provisioning your Flex Performance system, you adjust your anticipated storage and compute cores, then submit your choices.
{: shortdesc}

After your system is provisioned and whenever your needs change, you can adjust your compute cores up or down, and increase your storage. RAM is allocated proportionally as the number of compute cores is changed. A compute cores change results in a short system downtime. You can schedule the downtime to occur at a time that is more convenient or start the compute cores change immediately. Storage changes do not incur any downtime.
